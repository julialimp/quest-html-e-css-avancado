## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had some difficulty when choosing between the use of flexbox or grid in some situations, so it took me some more time because I tested both to see what was best for my page to keep responsive in all screen sizes.

For my first challenge, I think I could achieve what I was expecting and I really liked the results.


### Continued development

I'm looking forward to practicing some more HTML and CSS properties so I can master it soon enough. Besides that, I really enjoyed working on this project.
